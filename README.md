**pedroTheDev/pedroTheDev** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Front End and mobile development
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Back End Development (MySQL, MongoDB)

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love rugby and I have two dogs!
